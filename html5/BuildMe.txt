## IDE
Notice: This is only if you're going to build for Windows. You don't have to install this if your main build target is HTML5.

1. Make sure to download and install [Visual Studio Community -- This will automatically download when clicked](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/3105fcfe-e771-41d6-9a1c-fc971e7d03a7/8eb13958dc429a6e6f7e0d6704d43a55f18d02a253608351b6bf6723ffdaf24e/vs_Community.exe)

 - `MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools - (Latest)`
 - `Windows 10 SDK - (Latest)`

3. (Optional) -- If you would like to install Visual Studio Code (as your main IDE), you may. Please make sure however you install the IDE section instructions.

## Make that Git feature useful
Now that you've installed everything, including Git, you can clone this repository.

If you have a terminal open, 
- Type `cd` then the path to where you will like to clone the rep. (ex: cd "C:\Users\(your username here)\Eterhox Engine"). Press Enter and continue with Step 2
- Type `git clone https://github.com/bloxee/Eterhox-Engine.git`
- After cloning the git, type `cd Eterhox-Engine`.

Congrats, you've cloned the latest version of Eterhox Engine.

## Building
You can build to whatever targets that Haxe supports (such as: windows, mac, linux, android, html5 by using the following command 
- `lime build (insert target)`

- When the build is complete, you'll not see it immediately. You'll have to go through the export folder that it made in the Source Folder.
- This: `Eterhox-Engine/export/release/(target)/bin`

Note: Other folders that are in the target folder isn't necessary. Only the bin folder is needed (as it contains the game itself.)
