What's New?

- FPS Counter (not visible in game but in code)
- Chart Editor fixes (I think??)
- Options bg color change (not so fun or unique)
- Created a Changelog in-game (OutdatedSubState.hx moment)
- and in Github!
- Improvements in certain files

What's Removed?
- Fullscreen (Yeah Fullscreen isn't it.)
- that weird Cutscene test that can be activated in TitleState 
(Removed it entirely because it's useless...In my opinion.)
- Master Volume (I don't know why it's there but I'll figure out if it serves a purpose or not)

Coming Soon
- Memory Usage Counter
- Watermarks (Similar to KE || Kade Engine -- Rest in Peace)
- Misses & Accuracy
- a good proper Options system

----------------------------
Still learning how to code in Haxe, I'll get there, just not today of course.
