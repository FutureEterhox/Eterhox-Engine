## Eterhox Engine
Eterhox Engine is a beta personal project made by Bloxee. This project is expected to improve the game in every way possible. Take [Kade Engine](https://github.com/KadeDev/Kade-Engine/) for example.

Notice: I'm learning Haxe. In fact, I have alot to learn about Haxe and JS. Everything in this mod is barebones so expect broken things here and there.
